This app is based on https://www.bobsburgersapi.com API.\
View and favorite information about characters, episodes, credits, and more from the animated series "Bob's Burgers".\
An app also has a machine learning model that will predict which Bob's Burgers character you look like.

I'v made this project for educational purposes, to use it as a reference for SwiftUI functionality.
The main functionality that was applied in this project are described below.

Views:
- Text (.font)
- Color (.ignoresSafeArea)
- Image (.resizable, .scaledToFill, .opacity, .ignoresSafeArea)
- ZStack
- TabView (.tabItem, .toolbarBackground)
- NavigationStack (.toolbar)
- ToolbarItem

Extensions for:
- Font
- Image

Useful functionality:
- String Catalog (Localizable for En and Ru with adaptive fonts)\

This project contains almost everything I know at the moment about SwiftUI and Swift programming.

Disclaimer:
The project was made for educational purposes only.
